## Reminder

ST-GCN has transferred to **MMSkeleton**,
and keep on developing as an flexible open source toolbox for skeleton-based human understanding.

Custom networks, data loaders and checkpoints of old st-gcn are compatible with MMSkeleton.
We will **stop supporting** this repository soon. You are welcome to migrate to new 
**[MMSkeleton](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmskeleton)**.

If you want to use old ST-GCN, please refer to [OLD_README.md](./OLD_README.md).
