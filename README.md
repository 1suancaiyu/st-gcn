## Reminder

ST-GCN has transferred to [MMSkeleton](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmskeleton),
and keep on developing as an flexible open source toolbox for skeleton-based human understanding.

This code base will soon be not maintained and exists as a historical artifact to supplement our AAAI paper:

> **Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition**, Sijie Yan, Yuanjun Xiong and Dahua Lin, AAAI 2018. [[Arxiv Preprint]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07455)
  
For more recent works please checkout MMSkeleton.
  
You are welcome to migrate to new 
[MMSkeleton](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmskeleton).
Custom networks, data loaders and checkpoints of old st-gcn are compatible with MMSkeleton.
If you want to use old ST-GCN, please refer to [OLD_README.md](./OLD_README.md).
